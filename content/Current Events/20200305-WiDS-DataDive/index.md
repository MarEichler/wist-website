Participants will be emailed the dataset on February 27, 2020 (one week before the event). They will have one week to load the dataset in R/Python and answer preliminary exploratory questions. At the data dive event, they will be given a question of interest from the Greater Chicago Red Cross. Teams will be selected to have their work presented at the downtown Chicago event , the following day, on March 6, 2020.
