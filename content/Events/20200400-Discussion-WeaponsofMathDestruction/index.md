## Introduction and Chapter 1
1. O’Neil defines WMD’s by opacity, scale, and damage.   Do you think these are appropriate qualifications? Should there be any others? 
2. O'Neil writes "Like gods, these mathematical models were opaque, their workings invisible to all but the highest priest in their domain: mathematicians and computer scientists" (Introduction, p 3). Do you think the comparison to religion is appropriate?  How as the role of mathematicians and computer scientists in culture and society changed over the past decade?   
3.  Is there a way to change the incentive structure such that companies want to use data fairly?  WMDs survive because they offer a black-box scapegoat tool for boosting profits. The profits are a visible, measurable incentive.   So how do we advertise and measure the advantages of frequently-tested, feedback-driven, fair algorithms?  How will this affect statistical consulting firms (like Mathematica in O'Neil's example)? 

## Chapter 2 

1. Assumptions are essential to building a good model.  O’Neil says that finance models she saw were based on the past on the assumption that patterns will repeat.  Other common assumptions in finance are that the market is general efficient and that investors act rationally.  Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these assumptions.

1. After going through the 2008 financial recession, O’Neil says “I was forced to confront the ugly truth: people had deliberately wielded formulas to impress rather than clarify” (Ch 2, p 44).    Do you think this is true in industry? What about in academia? 
1. O’Neil points out that jobs in finance and Big Tech recruit from top schools and pay employees large salaries.  “This leads to the fallacious conclusion that whatever they’re doing to bring in more money is good.  It 'adds value.' Otherwise, why would the market reward it?” (Ch 2, p 47). She refers to this as “economic Darwinism.” Does society appropriately value statistical work?
