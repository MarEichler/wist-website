# Discussion Questions  
## Introduction and Chapter 1 -  April 10th  

1. WMD's are defined by opacity, scale, and damage.  Do you think these are appropriate qualifications?  Should there be any others? 
2. O'Neil writes "Like gods, these mathematical models were opaque, their workings invisible to all but the highest priest in their domain: mathematicians and computer scientists." ^[O'Neil, Cathy. Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy. Penguin Books, 2018. Hardcover: pg 3]  Do you think the comparison to religion is appropriate?  How has the role of mathematicians and computer scientist in culture changed over the past decade? 
3. Do you agree with O'Neil's negative outlook on big data?  If not, why?  If so, what can we do to encourage improvement?
