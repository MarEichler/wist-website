This quarter WIST will be sponsoring a quarter-long book discussion.  Participants will read one or two chapters each week and then have a discussion.  Discussion sections will take place once a week on Friday's from 1:00pm CT using Zoom.  For spring quarter 2020, WIST will be reading Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil.

# Discussion Questions  
## Introduction and Chapter 1 -  April 10th  

1. WMD's are defined by opacity, scale and damage.  do you think these are appropirate qualifcations?  Show there be any others?  
2. O'Neil writes "Like gods, these mathematical models were opaque, their workings invisible to all but the highest priest in their domain: mathematicians and computer scientists."[^ONeil3] Do you think the comparison to religion is appropriate?  How as the role of mathmeticians and computer scientists in culture and society changed over the past decade?   
3.  Is there a way to change the incentive structure such that companies want to use data fairly?  WMDs survive because they offer a black-box scapegoat tool for boosting profits. The profits are a visible, measurable incentive.   So how do we advertise and measure the advantages of frequently-tested, feedback-driven, fair algorithms?  How will this affect statistical consulting firms (like Mathematica in O'Neil's example)?
