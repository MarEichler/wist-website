**Wednesday, February 19, 2020**  
**3:30 PM**  
Transportation Center, 600 Foster Street  
*Light reception to follow talk*  

**Abstract:** Evidence-based decision-making, particularly in the age of big data, demands statisticians not only contribute as scientists but also excel as leaders, communicators and collaborators. In this talk, I will reflect on my own journey as a statistician â€“ opportunities, successes, and missteps. Case studies from the healthcare arena will illustrate the importance of statistical science in policy, as well as underscore the need for statisticians to engage decision-makers and communicate information from a policy perspective while being mindful of the political realities. Based on experience in both industry and academe, I will share lessons learned as a statistical leader by both assignment and influence. The time is now to advance ubiquitous data-driven decisions, and statisticians are particularly well-suited to make the most of this opportunity.

<i> Event co-sponsored by the <b>McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences </b> and the<b> Association of Women in Mathmetatics </b> </i>
