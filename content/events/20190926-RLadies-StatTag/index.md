## Want to automatically update your Word document with R outputs? Lear StatTag!  
This event will teach participants how to use [StatTag](https://sites.northwestern.edu/stattag/) 
(free, open source software) to create a bi-directional
connection between R/RMarkdown and a Word
document so that all files can be edited separately, but
statistical content â€“ values, tables,
figures, etc., can be updated
automatically in Word.
